                  Training inexperienced but qualified graduates is a very
                  successful business model for many employers. Resources spent
                  on their training pays off handsomely in the short as well as
                  long term. The graduates develop a sense of belonging with the
                  Company, which helps in their long-term association. This
                  helps in lowering manpower turnover ratio, a very important
                  parameter now-a-days in any Corporation.

                  Inexperienced graduates do not carry the baggage of existing
                  management ideas developed over the years by a Company. They
                  can be molded to perfectly suit the needs of a company which
                  is so dynamic. As they do not carry the baggage of prevalent
                  management ideas; they can bring in new and fresh ideas. And
                  we are not just talking of the large savings a company will
                  accumulate over the years by employing the inexperienced
                  graduate over a seasoned operator.
